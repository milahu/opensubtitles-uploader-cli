# opensubtitles-uploader-cli

upload movie subtitles to [opensubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.org/)

## install

```
npm i -g https://github.com/milahu/opensubtitles-uploader-cli
```

## usage

```
opensubtitles-uploader [options] [video_file] subtitles_file
```

## why

- because [opensubtitles-uploader](https://github.com/vankasteelj/opensubtitles-uploader) is too complex (GUI based on NWJS)
- because [the webinterface uploader](https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/upload) does not support uploading of video-metadata (hash, duration)
